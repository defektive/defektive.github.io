  Attempting to embrace Python

I try to like python. I really do. I attempt to use it and be like all the other cool people. Sadly, I am a dumb python noob. I see an import like:
```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
```

Cool, lets install the `crypto` pacakge...
```bash
pip install crypto
```

It returns `command not found: pip`, fair enough. I am not a python dev, my environment isn't setup. Lets run the module.
```bash
python3 -m pip install crypto
```

More errors:
```
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew install
    xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,
    use a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install xyz

    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with

    brew install pipx

    You may restore the old behavior of pip by passing
    the '--break-system-packages' flag to pip, or by adding
    'break-system-packages = true' to your pip.conf file. The latter
    will permanently disable this error.

    If you disable this error, we STRONGLY recommend that you additionally
    pass the '--user' flag to pip, or set 'user = true' in your pip.conf
    file. Failure to do this can result in a broken Homebrew installation.

    Read more about this behavior here: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/>

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
```

Ok, I guess venv's are no longer a suggestion and instead a way of life.

```bash
mkdir -p  ~/python-sucks/venv-for-crypto
python3 -m venv  ~/python-sucks/venv-for-crypto
source ~/python-sucks/venv-for-crypto/bin/activate
```

hey it works!

Lets have some fun and start writing python.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
```

Sadness...
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-0>", line 1, in <module>
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Crypto'
```

cant find the `Crypto` module.
oh hey. I am on a mac, I guess i need some special hacks. I seen this in some random code.

```python
import sys
import crypto
sys.modules["Crypto"] = crypto
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
```

More Sadness...
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-5>", line 1, in <module>
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Crypto.Cipher'
```

oh, this is for the `Crypto.Cipher`. Lets look at our package.
```bash
ls ~/python-sucks/venv-for-crypto/lib/python3.13/site-packages/crypto
```
hrmm. no cipher folder.
```
__init__.py    __pycache__    app.py         decryptoapp.py library        settings.py
```

oh hey. I think I need `pycrypto` instead of crypto.

```bash
python3 -m pip install pycrypto
```
Lets see if it works

```python
import sys
import crypto
sys.modules["Crypto"] = crypto
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
```

yay! it does. it feels wrong. what did this just do? it installed pycrypto package in the existing crypto folder? yes it did. hooray for case insensitive file systems combined with removing the py prefix on the installed module.

Lets create a new venv and install the right module.

```
mkdir -p  ~/python-sucks/venv-for-crypto-2
python3 -m venv  ~/python-sucks/venv-for-crypto-2
source ~/python-sucks/venv-for-crypto-2/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install pycrypto
```

and finally try just the initial line that started this adventure.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
```

Yes! It works the way it should.
