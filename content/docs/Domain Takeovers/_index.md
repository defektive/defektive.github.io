## Domain Takeovers

Domain takeovers or subdomain takeovers occur when DNS records are not properly updated or removed when a service is moved or shut down. Best case the domain just doesn't work anymore. Worst case a threat actor can leverage 3rd party services to serve malicious content using your domain / brand.
