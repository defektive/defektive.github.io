Setting the stage for things to come.

- We are going to setup phishing infrastructure.
- Our infrastructure will allow us to:
    - Manage phishing campaigns (Gophish).
    - Send emails (Mailhog for testing, ??? for production).
    - Coordinate requests between users and a login provider (Modlishka).
    - Hide from detections / bots.
    - Acquire a CSV of users to target (First Name, Last Name, Email, Role).
