Now we can go back to gophsih, clone our first credential harvesting campaign, modify the URL to point to Modlishka (http://modlishka.docker).

Feel free to go through the whole flow. It shouldn't be any different from the previous step besides the fact we are opening the link from an email instead of directly browsing to it.
