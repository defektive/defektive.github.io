Sixteen years ago I began learning to program in order to learn how to break programs. I have been building and breaking ever since. I love learning new things, writing code, and sharing my passion for security. This makes finding and exploiting software vulnerabilities extremely rewarding for me. I take pride in clean code, even if it is exploit code.

Currently, I lead a small team of talented penetration testers. I oversee everything from scheduling to reporting. I am hands on keyboard alongside my team and believe we can learn from each other every day. Engagements range from code review to full scope black box penetration tests.
