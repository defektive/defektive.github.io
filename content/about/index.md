Twenty years ago I began learning to program in order to learn how to break programs. I have been building and breaking ever since. I love learning new things, writing code, and sharing my passion for security. This makes finding and exploiting software vulnerabilities extremely rewarding for me. I take pride in clean code, even if it is exploit code.

## Professionally, 
I lead a small team of talented penetration testers. I oversee everything from scheduling to reporting. I am hands on keyboard alongside my team and believe we can learn from each other every day. Engagements range from code review to full scope black box penetration tests.

In my spare time, I am learning new things and sharing that information here.
